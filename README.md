Download [Sidecar.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/ryoppippi/alfred-sidecar-toggle/blob/main/Toggle%20Sidecar.alfredworkflow) and you can load it by [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)

Tested on Alfred 4 and macOS 11.6.

Probably you can use it on macOS 12.

This workflow is based on a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/il8x0y/is_it_possible_to_automatically_connect_to/g3tlhxc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).
